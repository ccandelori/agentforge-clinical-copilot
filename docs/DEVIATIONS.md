# Deviations from the Original Plan

A chronological log of decisions where we did something different from
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md), the original Taskmaster task spec,
or our initial assumption. Each entry captures **what changed**, **why**,
and **what we learned**.

The log exists so a future reader can recover the *reasoning* behind
divergences that look unmotivated against the planning artifacts. Big
architectural decisions also get an ADR in [`docs/adr/`](./adr/) when
created; this file is the lightweight running record.

## 2026-04-30 — Dropped `langchain` from sidecar dependencies

**Plan:** Taskmaster Task 5.1 (`pyproject.toml`) listed both `langgraph` and
`langchain` as production dependencies.

**Deviation:** Dropped top-level `langchain`; kept `langgraph` only.

**Why:** `langgraph` already pulls `langchain-core` transitively, and the
orchestrator uses LangGraph directly per ARCHITECTURE.md §3 ("Why LangGraph
and not vanilla LangChain"). No code path needs top-level `langchain`
chain primitives.

**What we learned:** Task specs written before the dep graph is verified can
carry redundant entries. Verify transitive availability before pinning every
named package — the lock surface should reflect what we actually import,
not what we think we'll need.

**Artifacts:** [commit d6dcea5e2](../sidecar/pyproject.toml).

## 2026-04-30 — Switched FastAPI app to factory pattern (test-driven discovery)

**Plan:** Task 5.3 (`main.py`) had `app = create_app()` at module level so
uvicorn could discover the app via `agentforge.main:app`.

**Deviation:** Removed the module-level `app`; production now runs
`uvicorn agentforge.main:create_app --factory`. Dockerfile ENTRYPOINT and
README updated to match.

**Why:** Module-level `app = create_app()` triggers `Settings()` instantiation
at *import* time. When pytest imports `agentforge.main` for collection, that
fires *before* a fixture can monkeypatch the required `JWT_SECRET` and
`HMAC_KEY` env vars — the test fails with Pydantic validation errors. The
factory pattern defers config loading to invocation, preserving fail-fast
on missing config in production while letting tests construct app instances
independently.

**What we learned:** "Required without default" config fields fight with
Python's import-time evaluation. The factory pattern is the standard FastAPI
way to defer this and should have been the default. Worth checking: any
future `app = X()` at module level for code that depends on Settings is a
landmine for testing.

**Artifacts:** [commit d40253ec9](../sidecar/src/agentforge/main.py).

## 2026-04-30 — Used Doctrine Migrations despite `db/README.md` "not yet integrated" warning

**Plan:** Task 40 spec said "Doctrine or direct" SQL migration. `CLAUDE.md`
says "New schema changes use Doctrine Migrations." `db/README.md` warns:
"The Doctrine Migrations system is NOT fully integrated into OpenEMR yet.
Don't make database changes using this until #10708 is completed."

**Deviation:** Followed CLAUDE.md. Schema change ships as a Doctrine
migration even though the upstream integration is incomplete.

**Why:** User instruction: "honor claude.md." When CLAUDE.md and an in-repo
README disagree, CLAUDE.md is authoritative — it is the project-specific
instruction set, while `db/README.md` reflects upstream OpenEMR's state.

**What we learned:** When CLAUDE.md and another in-repo doc disagree, surface
the conflict and ask before picking. The user has context the docs may not.
Practical follow-on: because the migration system isn't auto-integrated,
existing installs need a manual `./cli migrations:migrate` step to apply
indexes; documented in
[`oe-module-agentforge/README.md`](../interface/modules/custom_modules/oe-module-agentforge/README.md)
as a pre-deploy gate. Fresh installs bypass the migration runner via
`sql/database.sql`, so we updated both paths.

**Artifacts:** [commit f35cc1f47](../db/Migrations/Version20260430000001.php),
[`oe-module-agentforge/README.md`](../interface/modules/custom_modules/oe-module-agentforge/README.md).

## 2026-04-30 — Kept redundant `idx_procedure_report_date` (deferred to Task 49)

**Plan:** Task 40.1 spec listed seven indexes, including
`idx_procedure_report_date(procedure_report_id, date_report)` on
`procedure_report`.

**Deviation:** None at the schema level — the index ships as specified.
Created Taskmaster Task 49 (low priority, depends on Task 40) to revisit
post-MVP.

**Why:** `procedure_report_id` is the table's PRIMARY KEY. InnoDB tables are
clustered on the PK, so a secondary index leading with the PK is unlikely to
be selected by the optimizer over the clustered index. The spec is buggy on
this entry. User chose to follow the spec for parity rather than deviate
based on Claude's analysis ("less to touch = less I can break"). Cost to
live with is small (~1-3% slower writes on `procedure_report`, modest
storage). Cost to repay is one trivial `DROP INDEX` migration.

**What we learned:** "Trust the spec when you can't independently verify the
analysis" is a defensible conservative posture, especially when learning a
codebase. The deferral mechanism (Task 49 + comment in the migration's
`getDescription()` + this entry) makes the debt visible without forcing a
decision now. Tracked debt is much cheaper than invisible debt.

**Artifacts:**
[`db/Migrations/Version20260430000001.php`](../db/Migrations/Version20260430000001.php),
Taskmaster Task 49.

## 2026-04-30 — Registered AgentForge templates dir in TwigTemplateCompilationTest

**Plan:** Task 1.4 created
[`oe-module-agentforge/templates/agent_panel.html.twig`](../interface/modules/custom_modules/oe-module-agentforge/templates/agent_panel.html.twig)
extending `patient/card/card_base.html.twig`. The Task 1 spec did not call
out updating the project's existing Twig compilation test infrastructure.

**Deviation:** Added
`'interface/modules/custom_modules/oe-module-agentforge/templates'` to the
`EXTRA_TEMPLATE_DIRS` constant in
[`tests/Tests/Isolated/Common/Twig/TwigTemplateCompilationTest.php`](../tests/Tests/Isolated/Common/Twig/TwigTemplateCompilationTest.php).

**Why:** The regression check during Task 40 wrap-up surfaced a failing
isolated test:
`TwigTemplateCompilationTest::templateCompiles with data set "...agent_panel.html.twig"`.
The compilation test discovers `.twig` files via `SEARCH_DIRS` and compiles
them through a Twig environment whose `FilesystemLoader` is built from
`EXTRA_TEMPLATE_DIRS`. Without our module's templates dir in that list,
the loader couldn't resolve `{% extends "patient/card/card_base.html.twig" %}`
during compilation, even though the actual runtime Twig environment (built
by `Bootstrap` via `TwigContainer`) would have resolved it fine.

**What we learned:** Adding a Twig template in a new module isn't fully
self-contained — the project has a separate test-time Twig harness with its
own template-path registry. Any new module that ships templates needs an
entry in `EXTRA_TEMPLATE_DIRS`. This is now part of the implicit
"new module checklist" alongside `openemr.bootstrap.php`, `info.txt`, etc.
Worth folding into the bootstrapping flow when we add modules going forward.

**Artifacts:** [commit pending in this branch],
[`oe-module-agentforge/templates/agent_panel.html.twig`](../interface/modules/custom_modules/oe-module-agentforge/templates/agent_panel.html.twig),
[`tests/Tests/Isolated/Common/Twig/TwigTemplateCompilationTest.php`](../tests/Tests/Isolated/Common/Twig/TwigTemplateCompilationTest.php).

## 2026-04-30 — Stripped half-finished dependency storage from Bootstrap.php

**Plan:** Task 1.2 spec defined `Bootstrap.php` with constructor-stored
`$twig`, `$logger`, and `$eventDispatcher` properties (mirroring the
existing `oe-module-comlink-telehealth` and `oe-module-claimrev-connect`
patterns).

**Deviation:** Removed the `$twig`, `$logger`, and `$eventDispatcher`
property storage. The constructor still accepts these parameters (per
OpenEMR's module-loader contract) but does not retain them. Storage will
be reintroduced in Task 2 when `subscribeToEvents()` begins registering
listeners that actually need them. Also added `assert()` calls in
`openemr.bootstrap.php` to narrow the `$classLoader` and `$eventDispatcher`
globals injected by OpenEMR's `ModulesApplication`.

**Why:** PHPStan level 10 (per CLAUDE.md) flagged the stored-but-unused
properties as `property.onlyWritten`. Other modules suppress this with
baseline entries — but CLAUDE.md says "Avoid baselines. Never add new
baseline entries — fix the underlying type error" *and* "no half-finished
implementations either." Both directives point the same way: don't store
dependencies before you use them. Stripping is the honest fix.

The bootstrap.php globals were similarly flagged (`method.nonObject`,
`variable.undefined`) because PHPStan can't see through OpenEMR's
inject-by-name pattern. CLAUDE.md says "Avoid inline `@var` casts" — so
instead of `/** @var */`, we use `assert($x instanceof Y)`, which is
runtime-defensive in dev (where `assert.active=1`) and a no-op in
production. PHPStan understands the assertion for type narrowing.

**What we learned:** Two things worth recording:
1. The spec mirrored a pattern from established modules whose Bootstrap
   classes are *complete*. Copying their structure for a stub class
   imports the half-finished anti-pattern. Better to strip down and grow.
2. OpenEMR's project practice (baseline entries for module bootstrap globals)
   conflicts with CLAUDE.md's "avoid baselines" rule. The `assert(... instanceof ...)`
   idiom satisfies both — it's the right pattern for any future module
   bootstrap files we add.

**Artifacts:**
[`oe-module-agentforge/openemr.bootstrap.php`](../interface/modules/custom_modules/oe-module-agentforge/openemr.bootstrap.php),
[`oe-module-agentforge/src/Bootstrap.php`](../interface/modules/custom_modules/oe-module-agentforge/src/Bootstrap.php).
